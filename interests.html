				experience new things. To be curious and to grow. Some interests of mine include building things, math, and swimming.</h3>

			<h2>Building things</h2>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td><h3 style="width: 50%;">As humans we should all have the thought of building something that can last for a very long time or help others.
						That is the reason to why I find buildings interesting. It is a chance to create something permanent and make a mark on this world for when 
						I am gone.

			<table>
				<tr>
					<td><h3 style="width: 50%;">I enjoy swimming because of the fact that it is a different environment from being on land. When you're in water
					it seems as if gravity no longer applies to you and you may do whatever you wish. I also enjoy swimming because 70% of the Earth's area
					is made up of water and swimming would be a good skill to have if I were to ever fall into the water and need to swim back.</h3></td>

				<table>
					<tr>
						<td><h3 style="width: 50%;">I think math is interesting because of the logic behind it. I find that in today's day to day life so much is subjective and controversial.
						But with math there is only one right answer and that to me serves as something that we can all agree on. And having something that we all agree on
						is rare to find right now.</h3></td>
